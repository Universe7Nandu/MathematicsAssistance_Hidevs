```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Make sure `requirements.txt` includes `pytesseract`, `pillow`, `streamlit`, and other needed packages.

### 3. Install Tesseract OCR

- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
  ```
- **Windows:**
  - [Download Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and add it to your system’s PATH.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You can then open the app in your browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

## 🧩 How the Chatbot Works

1. **User Interaction**
   - Type a question or greeting in the main chat input.
   - If you prefer images, use the sidebar to upload a math problem image.

2. **OCR & Parsing**
   - If an image is uploaded, `pytesseract` extracts text.
   - The extracted text becomes your query.

3. **LLM Processing**
   - The system uses **Langchain-Groq** with a multi-turn memory approach.
   - The **system prompt** ensures consistent LaTeX formatting and step-by-step logic.

4. **Response Generation**
   - The chatbot provides a friendly, moderate-length answer.
   - If plotting is requested, it creates an interactive Plotly chart.

5. **Context Memory**
   - The app keeps a record of the conversation in `st.session_state`.
   - You can ask “What was my previous question?” or refer to past steps.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Tesseract Not Found:**
  - Make sure you have installed Tesseract OCR and added it to your PATH.
  - On Streamlit Cloud, add `tesseract-ocr` to your `packages.txt`.

- **LaTeX Formatting Issues:**
  - The chatbot uses $$...$$ for display math.
  - Avoid raw LaTeX environments like `\begin{align}`.
  - If formatting is off, check the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` instructions.

- **Plot Not Displaying:**
  - Ensure you typed something like “Plot x^2 from -2 to 2.”
  - The chatbot might skip plotting if it doesn’t detect a “plot” command.
